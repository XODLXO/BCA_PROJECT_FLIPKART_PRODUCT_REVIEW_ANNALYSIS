## 📊 Customer Feedback Analysis Dashboard (Sentify Analysis)

This project is an AI-powered web application built using **Streamlit** that analyzes customer reviews and transforms raw textual feedback into meaningful business insights. The main goal is to help businesses understand customer sentiment, identify issues, and make data-driven decisions in real time.

## 🤖 Model & Approach

The core of this system is a machine learning pipeline based on:

* **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) for understanding textual reviews
* **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical features
* A trained classification model (sentiment analysis) that predicts whether a review is:

  * **Positive**
  * **Negative**
  * **Neutral**

### 🔗 Model Files (Loaded from Cloud)

To ensure easy deployment and no local dependency issues, the trained model and vectorizer are hosted online and loaded dynamically:

* **Final Model (.pkl):**

* **TF-IDF Vectorizer (.pkl):**

This approach allows the app to run directly on platforms like Streamlit Cloud without requiring local model files.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user uploads a dataset (CSV) containing product reviews
2. The system automatically:

   * Detects relevant columns (review, rating, product, etc.)
   * Cleans and preprocesses the data
3. Reviews are transformed using TF-IDF
4. The trained model predicts sentiment for each review
5. Results are displayed through interactive dashboards and graphs

## 🧭 Dashboard Navigation & Features

The application is designed with a **step-by-step, user-friendly interface** so even non-technical users can easily interact with it.

---

### 🟢 Step 1: Data Input

Users can:

* Use built-in sample data
* OR upload their own CSV file

The app intelligently adapts to different column names and formats.

---

### 🟡 Step 2: Product Selection

If multiple products exist, the user selects one product from a dropdown.
This ensures **focused and accurate analysis** instead of mixing all products together.

---

### 🔵 Step 3: KPI Overview

Key performance indicators are displayed:

* Total reviews
* Positive sentiment %
* Negative sentiment %
* Neutral sentiment %

This gives a quick understanding of customer perception.

---

### 📊 Overview Tab

Provides a high-level summary:

* Bar chart of sentiment distribution
* Pie chart showing sentiment share
* Additional distribution insights

---

### 💡 Insights Tab

This is the **analytical core** of the application:

* Sentiment vs Rating analysis
* Review length vs sentiment
* Price vs sentiment (auto-detected)
* Rating distribution
* Sentiment trends

The system automatically handles:

* Numeric or text-based price values
* Different column naming formats

---

### 🔤 Text Analysis Tab

Focuses on understanding the actual feedback content:

* Word Cloud visualization
* Top frequently used keywords
* Helps identify common customer opinions

---

### 🚀 Next Steps (Business Recommendations)

Instead of static outputs, the app provides **dynamic AI-driven suggestions**, such as:

* Improve product quality (if negative sentiment is high)
* Launch marketing campaigns (if positive sentiment is high)
* Investigate pricing or quality issues based on keywords

This makes the tool **actionable**, not just analytical.
